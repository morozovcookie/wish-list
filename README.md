# Preamble

I have started this project few times - on the third try I decided to create a repository on github.com. 
This project is the way to learn the best way for project organisation, and practice with domain driven design. I have 
decided that I do not need another hell of microservices. I want to try to build monolithic application with the great 
domain structure that could be cut on the separate microservices later like Martin Fowler said. This is the great 
opportunity for that. 
This application should be represented a like social media service when you could create wish lists and share it with 
your friends. It is a great choice for save yourself from a headache when you need to buy a present for someone, for 
example, and you do not know what you need.
